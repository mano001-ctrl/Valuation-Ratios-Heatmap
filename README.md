# Valuation-Ratios-Heatmap
This repository provides interactive visualizations for popular investment ratios, allowing users to explore and compare key financial metrics across companies and industries. The project focuses on several groups of ratios:

• Valuation Ratios: Price-to-Book, Price-to-Sales, Price-to-Cash Flow, EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow, and PEG
• Profitability Ratios: Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA)
• Leverage Ratios: Debt-to-Equity (D/E)
• Dividend Ratios: Dividend Yield and Dividend Payout Ratio

By combining data analysis with interactive charts and dashboards, this tool helps investors, analysts, and students quickly assess a company’s valuation, profitability, financial health, and risk profile. Built with Python and modern visualization libraries, it provides a flexible, user-friendly framework for exploring and interpreting these essential financial metrics.
